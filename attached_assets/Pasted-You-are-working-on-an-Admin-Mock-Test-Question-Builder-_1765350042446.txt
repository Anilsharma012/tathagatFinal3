You are working on an Admin “Mock Test > Question Builder” page.

Current UI:
- Left panel: “Add New Question” form with fields including:
  - Question Type
  - Section (dropdown: VARC, DILR, QA, General)
  - Question Text, etc.
- Right panel: “Questions (N)” list showing existing questions.
- Currently the right panel appears to show a single combined list, and the section header like “GENERAL (49 questions)” does not dynamically reflect per-section grouping when new questions are added.

Goal:
Implement section-wise grouping of questions in the right-side list.

Core Requirement:
When an admin creates/updates a question and selects a Section:
1) The question must appear under the corresponding Section group on the right panel.
2) The right panel must display separate section blocks for each section that has at least 1 question.

UI Behavior:
- Render section headers in the format:
  “SECTION_NAME (X questions)”
  Example:
  - “GENERAL (49 questions)”
  - “QA (12 questions)”
  - “VARC (8 questions)”
  - “DILR (5 questions)”
- Under each header, list the questions belonging to that section.
- If a section has 0 questions, do not show that section group.
- The total count “Questions (N)” should still reflect all questions combined.

Ordering:
- Section groups should appear in a logical fixed order:
  VARC → DILR → QA → General
- Within each section, keep the current ordering logic already used (e.g., newest first or existing sort).

Real-time update:
- After adding a new question (single add):
  - The appropriate section group should update immediately (without full page refresh).
  - The count in the header should increment correctly.
- After editing a question’s section:
  - The question should move from the old section group to the new one.
  - Both groups’ counts should update.

Bulk Upload CSV:
- If CSV upload supports a “section” field:
  - Ensure imported questions are grouped correctly by their section in the UI.
  - Unknown/missing section should default to “General”.

Consistency:
- Keep the existing question card UI (tags like Q1, TITA/MCQ, difficulty chips, etc.).
- Only change the list structure to be section-wise grouped.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Adding a QA question creates/updates a “QA (X questions)” group and shows the question there.
- Adding a VARC question creates/updates a “VARC (X questions)” group and shows the question there.
- Counts update accurately for each section and for total.
- No empty section headers.
- Editing section reassigns the question to the correct group.

Deliverables:
- Update data mapping and UI rendering logic to group questions by section.
- Ensure the feature works for:
  - Single add
  - Edit
  - Delete
  - Bulk CSV upload

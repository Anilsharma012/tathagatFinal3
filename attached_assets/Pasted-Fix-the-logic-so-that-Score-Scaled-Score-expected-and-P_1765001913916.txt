Fix the logic so that Score, Scaled Score (expected), and Percentile are computed correctly and never show fake defaults.

1) CAT Marking Rules (must be applied)

MCQ correct = +3

MCQ wrong = −1

TITA/Non-MCQ wrong = 0

Unattempted = 0

If the UI only has “Correct” and “Incorrect” without MCQ/TITA split, then:

Clearly label the score as “Estimated Raw Score”

Or add an internal assumption field for Wrong MCQ vs Wrong TITA

2) Section-wise Raw Score Formula

Use:

Raw Score
=
3
×
(
Correct
)
−
1
×
(
Wrong MCQ
)
Raw Score=3×(Correct)−1×(Wrong MCQ)

Important:

Do NOT assume:

Wrong MCQ
=
Incorrect
Wrong MCQ=Incorrect

unless the app explicitly confirms Incorrect = only MCQ wrong.

3) “Incorrect” Display Clarification

Many calculators show:

Incorrect
=
Wrong MCQ
+
Wrong TITA
Incorrect=Wrong MCQ+Wrong TITA

So negative marking should apply only to MCQ wrong.

The UI must show a small note:
“Incorrect may include TITA. Negative marks apply only to MCQs.”

4) Expected Scaled Score Logic

Since official IIM scaling is not public per user in real-time, the app should:

Treat scaled score as Expected Scaled Score

Use either:

Slot-wise estimated scaling model

Or fallback safely:

Expected Scaled Score
≈
Raw Score
Expected Scaled Score≈Raw Score

But clearly label it as estimate.

5) Correct Percentile Formula (Data-driven)

Percentile must be based on a dataset of responses (example: 45k responses).

Use:

Percentile
=
100
×
#
(
scores
<
𝑆
)
𝑁
Percentile=100×
N
#(scores<S)
	​


For tie-safe version:

Percentile
=
100
×
#
(
scores
<
𝑆
)
+
0.5
×
#
(
scores
=
𝑆
)
𝑁
Percentile=100×
N
#(scores<S)+0.5×#(scores=S)
	​


Where:

𝑆
S = user’s raw/expected scaled score

𝑁
N = total responses in dataset

6) Zero/Empty State Rules (must be fixed)

If:

Correct
=
0
and
Incorrect
=
0
Correct=0andIncorrect=0

Then:

Score must show:

0
0

Percentile should show either:

0.00

or “Not enough attempts”

Do NOT show random defaults like 10/12/15.

7) Guardrails (No Fake Numbers)

Remove any hardcoded fallback percentiles.

If dataset is not loaded or unavailable:

show “Percentile unavailable”

not a guessed number.

8) UI Output Requirements

Section table must reflect:

Correct

Incorrect

Raw Score

Expected Scaled Score

Expected Percentile

Overall row should be computed from totals (not averaged blindly).

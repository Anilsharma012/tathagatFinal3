There is a frontend page currently showing two sections:

Previous Years' Papers

Topic-Wise Previous Years' Questions

This page currently shows static/hardcoded categories and test cards with a “COMING SOON” overlay.

Strict UI Rule

Do NOT change the UI design.
Do NOT modify layout, spacing, fonts, colors, card structure, tabs styling, or section headings.
Only convert the page into a fully dynamic, admin-controlled system while preserving the exact same look and feel.

1) Frontend Navbar Link Requirement

The public frontend Navbar already has a “Download” button.
This button must link to the same page where these two sections exist.
Do not change Navbar UI (only fix or ensure the correct route connection).

Use the existing route for this page (for example /mock-test or the current configured route in the project).

Do not rename routes unless absolutely required.

2) Admin Navigation Requirement

Add a new admin-side navigation/button named:

“Download”

This must open an admin management module to control both:

Previous Years' Papers

Topic-Wise Previous Years' Questions

This admin module must be protected with admin authentication.

3) Admin Features (Apply Same System to Both Sections)
A) Category/Tab Management

Admin should be able to:

Create new categories/tabs

Edit category/tab name

Enable/disable category visibility on frontend

Set category display order

Examples:

Exam categories: CAT, XAT, SNAP, NMAT, MHCET, SRCC

Topic categories: Algebra, Geometry, Arithmetic, Number System

Tabs must render dynamically on frontend from backend.

B) Test Card Management Inside Categories

Admin should be able to:

Add new test entries

Edit test details (title + any meta shown on the existing card UI)

Delete tests

Set test display order

All tests must render on frontend in the same existing card format.

C) “COMING SOON” Status Control

Each test must have a status:

COMING_SOON

PUBLISHED

Frontend rule:

If COMING_SOON → show the existing “COMING SOON” overlay exactly as currently designed

If PUBLISHED → overlay must not appear

Admin must be able to toggle this status anytime.

D) Paper/Content Upload

Admin must be able to upload/attach content to a test:

PDF upload and/or structured question set (based on the existing project’s test engine)

Store file securely (using project’s preferred storage approach)

Save content metadata/reference in database

Admin should be able to mark a test as PUBLISHED only when ready.

4) Frontend Runtime Behavior (Both Sections)
A) Dynamic Rendering

Replace hardcoded data with API-driven data:

Categories/tabs come from backend

Tests inside categories come from backend

B) Overlay Logic

Show “COMING SOON” overlay only when status = COMING_SOON.

C) Click-to-Attempt Flow

When a user clicks a test card:

If user is not logged in:

Redirect to login

After successful login, return the user back to the same selected test

If user is logged in:

Open the test attempt flow on the same system/format already used in the project

This login-gated attempt flow must work identically for:

Previous Years’ Papers tests

Topic-Wise Previous Years’ Questions tests

5) Backend/API Requirements

Create a clean, scalable structure that supports two types of content:

PREVIOUS_YEAR

TOPIC_WISE

Recommended models/fields:

Category

id

type: PREVIOUS_YEAR | TOPIC_WISE

name

slug (optional)

order

isActive

Test

id

categoryId

type: PREVIOUS_YEAR | TOPIC_WISE

title

meta fields (only those already shown in UI if applicable)

order

status: COMING_SOON | PUBLISHED

content reference:

pdfUrl (optional)

questionSetId (optional)

isActive

Required APIs
Public APIs

Fetch categories by type

Fetch tests by category

Fetch test details for attempt

Admin APIs (Admin Auth Required)

Create/Update/Delete Category

Create/Update/Delete Test

Upload/Attach content

Toggle status (COMING_SOON/PUBLISHED)

Reorder categories and tests

6) Acceptance Criteria

The frontend Navbar “Download” button opens this page correctly.

Admin can manage everything from Admin → Download.

Admin can add/edit/delete categories for both sections.

Admin can add/edit/delete tests under each category.

Admin can upload papers/content.

Admin can control Coming Soon vs Published per test.

Frontend removes overlay only when test is Published.

Clicking a test forces login first if the user is not authenticated.

The UI remains unchanged.

7) Non-Negotiables

No UI redesign.

No CSS/layout changes.

Keep headings, tabs, and card structure identical.

Only add dynamic data, admin controls, and auth-gated test attempt flow.

Admin Panel: Manage Questions (Create + Organize)

Build an admin screen where admin can:

A. Sections

Create/manage Sections: VARC, DILR, QA

Each question belongs to exactly one section.

B. Passage/Paragraph Based Question Set (1 paragraph → many questions)
Admin can choose “Passage/Paragraph” mode and paste/select a paragraph.

Admin must be able to add multiple questions under the same paragraph (unlimited questions).

So the structure is:

Passage (Paragraph)

Question 1

Question 2

Question 3

…

Passage content must support:

Rich text (bold, underline, bullet points)

Images (e.g., graphs/figures like DILR graph)

Scrollable passage area in frontend

C. Question Types + Input Modes
For every question, admin must choose Answer Input Type:

MCQ (Options)

Admin can add 2–6 options (usually 4)

Single correct option (CAT style)

Options can be text (and optionally image support)

Frontend shows radio options like CAT UI

TITA / Numeric / Text Answer (No options)

Admin selects: “Answer via Input box”

Frontend shows an input field + on-screen keypad (like screenshot)

D. Tools Toggle per Question
Admin must have toggles:

✅ Show Calculator/Keypad (for TITA)

✅ Show Options (for MCQ)

(Optional toggles like Draw/Zoom can be added, but minimum: calculator/keypad as required)

Rule:

If admin selects MCQ, show options UI in frontend.

If admin selects TITA, show input + keypad in frontend.

Don’t show both unless admin explicitly enables both (default: only one).

2) Student Test Player UI (Exact Screenshot Layout)

Build the test UI exactly CAT mock style:

A. Top Header

Tabs: VARC | DILR | QA

Show “Time Left: mm:ss”

Buttons: Instructions and Question Paper

Show marks info near question area:

“Marks for correct answer: X | Negative Marks: Y”

B. Main Body Layout
When question is under a Passage:

Left side: Passage/Paragraph area (scrollable)

Right side: Question + Answer UI (options or keypad)
This must match the screenshot: passage left, question right.

When question is not passage-based:

Question can take full width (or left area blank) but keep right panel + palette.

C. Virtual Keypad / Calculator (Working)
When question is TITA:

Show input field on top

Show keypad exactly like screenshot:

Digits: 0–9

Backspace

Clear All

Dot “.”

Minus “-”

Left/Right arrow (cursor move)

Keypad must be fully working:

Clicking keys types into input

Backspace removes

Clear All resets

Cursor arrows move caret

On “Save & Next”, the typed answer must be saved (persist).

D. Right Sidebar Question Palette
Build CAT-style palette with statuses:

Answered (green)

Not Answered (red)

Not Visited (grey)

Marked for Review (purple)

Answered & Marked for Review (special indicator)

Also include:

Section label (e.g., DILR)

“Choose a Question” grid buttons 1..N

E. Bottom Action Buttons
Add buttons exactly like CAT UI:

Mark for Review & Next

Clear Response

Previous

Save & Next

Submit

Actions update question status correctly.

3) Attempt Saving + Persistence (Very Important)

Implement attempt storage so that:

When student selects an option or types in keypad, it’s saved.

When student revisits a question, previous response reappears.

Status logic:

Not visited → first time open

Not answered → visited but no answer

Answered → answer saved

Marked for review → marked, even if answered

Save calls should happen on:

Save & Next

Mark for Review & Next

Optional autosave every few seconds (bonus)

Store:

selectedOptionId OR typedAnswer

visited flag

markedForReview flag

timeSpent per question (optional)

4) Data Model (Suggested)

Test

Section

Passage (optional)

Question (belongs to section; may belong to passage)

Option (for MCQ)

TestAttempt (per user per test)

AttemptAnswer (per question)

5) Acceptance Criteria

Admin can paste one paragraph and add unlimited questions under it.

Each question can be configured as MCQ (options) OR TITA (keypad).

Frontend shows passage left + question right for passage questions.

Keypad/calculator is fully interactive and answer is saved and restored.

UI matches CAT mock screenshots: tabs, timer, palette, statuses, and bottom buttons.

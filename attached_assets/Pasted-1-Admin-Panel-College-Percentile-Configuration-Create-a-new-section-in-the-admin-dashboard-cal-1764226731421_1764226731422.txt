1. Admin Panel – College & Percentile Configuration

Create a new section in the admin dashboard called “IIM Predictor – College Manager” with a primary button: “Add College (Percentile Based)”.

When the admin clicks this button, open a modal or separate page with a clean form to create/edit a college entry.

Each college record should have at least these fields (aligned with the sample table from iQuanta):

College Group / Bucket (dropdown)

“Top IIMs and FMS”

“IITs and IIFT”

“Newer IIMs”

“Other Top B-Schools” (fallback option)

College Name (text) – e.g. “IIM Ahmedabad”

Program Name / Tag (optional) – e.g. “PGPBA”, “ABM”, “HRM”

VARC %ile Cutoff (number)

DILR %ile Cutoff (number)

QA %ile Cutoff (number)

Overall Min %ile Cutoff (number)

Target Percentile (number, 0–100)

This is the main value used to decide whether the user is competitive for that college.

Conversion: Calls (in your category) (short text)

Example: 123 : 318, 389 : 910

Shortlisting Criteria URL (optional link)

Clicking an icon in results should open this in a new tab.

Display Order / Sort Order (number)

Status (Active / Inactive) – inactive rows should not show in the predictor.

Store these records in a persistent data source (reuse the project’s existing database or create a new table/collection, for example iim_colleges).

Also implement basic CRUD:

List view with a table of all colleges (columns same as the result table).

Actions per row: Edit, Delete, Toggle Active.

The list should be searchable by college name and filterable by college group.

2. Prediction Logic & Result Page Integration

The user form “LET’S PREDICT YOUR MBA COLLEGE” is already present with fields like:

Category (General/OBC/…)

Gender

10th stream + percentage

12th stream + percentage

Graduation stream + percentage

Work experience (if any)

“Have you taken CAT before?” (Yes/No + Year)

Interest in courses (CAT Full Course, NMAT+SNAP Course, XAT Course, CMAT Course)

Other existing fields in the form

Use this existing form as-is visually, but on Submit:

Calculate profile-based percentiles (or reuse existing logic if it already exists) for at least three buckets:

Top IIMs and FMS percentile

IITs and IIFT percentile

Newer IIMs percentile

Return from the backend a structured response that includes:

Basic profile evaluation:

academicsScore (0–100)

workExScore (0–100)

topIimsAndFmsPercentile (0–100)

iitsAndIiftPercentile (0–100)

newerIimsPercentile (0–100)

A list of eligible colleges and optionally all colleges from the admin database.

Eligibility rule:

For each college:

Pick the relevant bucket based on its “College Group / Bucket”:

Top IIMs & FMS → compare with topIimsAndFmsPercentile

IITs & IIFT → compare with iitsAndIiftPercentile

Newer IIMs → compare with newerIimsPercentile

Others → choose the closest bucket or use overall percentile if implemented

A college is “eligible” if the candidate’s bucket percentile ≥ Target Percentile and, if required, they also meet sectional cut-offs.

Provide a way to:

Show all colleges

Or filter to “Show only likely calls (eligible colleges)”.

3. Result Page UI – Match the Given Design

After form submission, navigate to a Profile Evaluation / Result page with the following layout (closely imitating iQuanta’s style but without copying their code):

Title section

Big heading at the top:

If the user’s first name is available, use:
"[Name]'s Profile Evaluation"

Otherwise: "Your Profile Evaluation".

Top Summary Bars

Two horizontal bar components:

Academics – a bar segmented into labels: “Weak”, “Adequate”, “Fine”, “Great”, with a circular slider/indicator positioned according to academicsScore.

Work Experience – similar segmented bar with the indicator based on workExScore.

Colors: soft red for Weak, yellow for Adequate, mint for Fine, green/teal for Great.

Smooth, modern styling consistent with existing app typography and spacing.

Three Percentile Cards (in one row on desktop, stacked on mobile):

Card 1:

Big bold number: topIimsAndFmsPercentile with “%ile” label.

Subtext: “Top IIMs and FMS”.

A thin horizontal percentile bar from 90 to 100 similar to the screenshot.

Card 2:

Same style.

Number: iitsAndIiftPercentile.

Subtext: “IITs and IIFT”.

Range typically 85–100.

Card 3:

Number: newerIimsPercentile.

Subtext: “Newer IIMs”.

Range typically 80–100.

College Table (below the cards) – exactly like the sample screenshot

Implement a responsive table with these columns:

Top B-Schools (college + program text)

VARC %ile Cutoff

DILR %ile Cutoff

QA %ile Cutoff

Overall Min %ile Cutoff

Target Percentile

Show this column with a subtle green background to highlight it.

Conversion: Calls (in your category)

Display conversionText as “123 : 318” or similar.

Shortlisting Criteria

Show a small “external link” icon. Clicking it should open the shortlistingUrl in a new tab if present.

Behaviour:

Use data from the admin-managed iim_colleges dataset.

Sort rows primarily by college group, then by target percentile.

Visually indicate eligibility, for example:

Bold text or a green left border for eligible colleges.

Optional tag “Likely Call” / “Stretch” next to college name depending on gap between user percentile and target percentile.

Responsiveness

On desktop, the layout should follow the reference screenshots:

Two bars on top

Three cards in one row

Wide college table below.

On mobile/tablet:

Stack the bars vertically.

Display the three percentile cards in a vertical stack or 2-column grid.

For the college list, use either a horizontally scrollable table or card-based layout that still shows all the same fields.

4. Data Flow & APIs

Implement or update APIs (or controllers) to support this flow:

Admin APIs

GET /admin/iim-colleges – list all colleges.

POST /admin/iim-colleges – create a college.

PUT /admin/iim-colleges/:id – update a college.

DELETE /admin/iim-colleges/:id – delete a college.

These routes must be protected using the existing admin auth mechanism.

Prediction API

POST /iim-predictor/evaluate

Input: all fields from the “LET’S PREDICT YOUR MBA COLLEGE” form.

Output:

academicsScore

workExScore

topIimsAndFmsPercentile

iitsAndIiftPercentile

newerIimsPercentile

list of colleges with an isEligible flag for each.

Frontend:

The existing predictor form should call this endpoint on submit, show a loading state, then render the new result page using the response.

5. General Requirements

Keep all typography, colors, and spacing consistent with the current site.

Use clean, maintainable components for:

Progress/percentile bars

College table

Admin college form

All labels and headings must be in clear, professional English.

Do not remove or break the existing form fields and functionality; only extend them.

Use this full specification to generate and integrate all necessary frontend components, backend endpoints, and database changes so that:

Admin can add/update colleges and their percentile cut-offs from the admin panel.

Users fill the “LET’S PREDICT YOUR MBA COLLEGE” form, get their bucket-wise percentiles, and see a result page that looks like the sample “Profile Evaluation” screenshots, with colleges pulled from admin data and filtered by their percentile.

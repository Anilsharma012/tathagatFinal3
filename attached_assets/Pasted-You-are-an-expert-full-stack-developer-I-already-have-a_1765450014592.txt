You are an expert full-stack developer. I already have a frontend page called `course-purchase` (Tathagat style) which is currently static. I want you to convert it into a dynamic, course-wise page that reads data from the admin panel, WITHOUT changing the existing design / layout / CSS classes.

TECH CONTEXT (IMPORTANT):
- Frontend: React (current page URL example: /course-purchase)
- There is already an "Add Course" / "Courses" module in the admin panel where courses are created (with fields like course name, price etc.).
- When a user goes to "Available Courses" and clicks "Enroll Now" on any course, I want them to be redirected to this dynamic course purchase page with that course's content.

YOUR TASKS:

1) ADMIN PANEL – NEW BUTTON + SCREEN
------------------------------------------------
a. In the admin panel, add a new menu item / button like: **“Manage Course Purchase Page”** or **“Course Detail Page Content”**.

b. On this screen:
   - Show a **dropdown to select an existing course** from the already created courses (fetched from the courses collection / table).
   - After selecting a course, admin should be able to fill/update all content for that course purchase page, in separate fields.

c. Create a proper data model for course purchase page content (can be a separate model or embedded in the Course model). It should include at least the following fields:

   HERO SECTION:
   - previewVideoUrl (YouTube or any video embed link)
   - mainTitle (e.g. "CAT 2025 FULL COURSE")
   - currentPrice
   - originalPrice (to show as striked price)
   - keyBullets (array of strings) for the bullet points under price:
     • Complete CAT preparation material
     • Live interactive classes
     • Mock tests and practice sets
     • Doubt clearing sessions
     • Performance analysis
     • Study materials download

   ABOUT & LEARNING SECTION:
   - aboutTitle (e.g. "About The Course")
   - aboutDescription (rich text / long text)
   - learningHeading (e.g. "OR WHAT WILL YOU LEARN??")
   - learningContent (paragraph or list as required)

   CURRICULUM SECTION:
   - curriculumSections: array of objects; each object has:
     • sectionTitle (e.g. "Welcome! Course Introduction", "Foundation Phase – Concept Building", "Application Phase – Practice & Assignments", "iCAT Mock Test Series", "CAT Crash Course – Final Lap")
     • sectionSubtitle / description (one short line under the title)
     • optionally a list of lessons/topics if needed
   - This should map to the existing accordion UI on the frontend, without changing design.

   MATERIAL INCLUDES BOX (RIGHT SIDEBAR):
   - materialHeading (e.g. "Material Includes")
   - materialItems: array of bullet strings like:
     • Certificate of Completion
     • 444 downloadable resource
     • Full lifetime access
     • 1300+ Hours of Videos
     • 20 Mocks & 45 Sectional Mocks

   REQUIREMENTS BOX (RIGHT SIDEBAR):
   - requirementsHeading (e.g. "Requirements")
   - requirementsItems: array of strings (each shown as bullet point, design same as now)

   INSTRUCTOR SECTION:
   - instructors: array of objects; each object:
     • name
     • expertise (e.g. "Quant/LRDI", "Verbal")
     • imageUrl (for instructor photo card)
   - Use these fields to populate the existing instructor cards, keeping same layout and styles.

   REVIEWS SECTION:
   - averageRating (e.g. 4.0)
   - totalRatings (e.g. 6)
   - ratingBreakdown: object/array with count for 5,4,3,2,1 stars (used for horizontal bars)
   - reviews: array of objects; each object includes:
     • reviewerName
     • reviewText
     • rating (1–5)
     • timeAgo (e.g. "a year ago")
   - Bind these values to the existing “Our Valuable Reviews” section and the review card design; no UI redesign.

d. Allow admin to:
   - CREATE content for a course if not present.
   - UPDATE the existing content for a selected course.
   - SAVE data to the database (server + API endpoints as needed).
   Make sure validation is present (required fields, etc.).

2) FRONTEND – DYNAMIC COURSE PURCHASE PAGE
------------------------------------------------
a. Convert `course-purchase` into a **dynamic, course-specific route**, for example:
   - `/course-purchase/:courseId` or `/course-purchase/:slug`
   Use whatever routing style is already used in the project, but the idea is: each course has its own unique URL that loads its own content.

b. On this page:
   - Fetch course purchase data from the backend using the courseId/slug.
   - Bind EVERY piece of text, price, list, image, and video to the fields defined above.
   - The layout, structure, CSS classes, spacing, colors, typography etc. must remain EXACTLY the same as my current static design (as in my current screenshot). Only the content should be dynamic.

   Specific bindings:
   - Hero video iframe / video player uses `previewVideoUrl`.
   - Big title on the right uses `mainTitle`.
   - Current price and striked price use `currentPrice` and `originalPrice`.
   - Bullet list below price uses `keyBullets`.
   - "About The Course" title and paragraph use `aboutTitle` and `aboutDescription`.
   - Learning heading and content use `learningHeading` and `learningContent`.
   - Course curriculum accordions are generated from `curriculumSections` array.
   - “Material Includes” box uses `materialHeading` and `materialItems`.
   - “Requirements” box uses `requirementsHeading` and `requirementsItems`.
   - Instructor cards use `instructors` array (image, name, expertise).
   - Ratings summary and bars use `averageRating`, `totalRatings`, and `ratingBreakdown`.
   - Individual review card(s) use data from `reviews` array.

c. Handle loading and error states cleanly (spinner or simple “Loading…” text), but do NOT break the main design.

3) ENROLL NOW → REDIRECT FLOW
------------------------------------------------
a. On the **Available Courses** page, for every course card:
   - The “Enroll Now” button should redirect the user to that course’s purchase page using its unique id/slug.
   - Example: clicking “Enroll Now” on CAT 2025 should route to `/course-purchase/cat-2025-full-course` (or the correct dynamic URL).

b. Ensure:
   - If a course has no purchase content configured yet, show a simple message like “Course details coming soon” but keep the skeleton design.
   - Otherwise always render the full dynamic content.

4) GENERAL RULES
------------------------------------------------
- DO NOT change existing styles, design, layout, or class names more than absolutely necessary. The page should look visually identical to my current static `course-purchase` design.
- Keep the code clean, modular, and well-structured.
- Comment the important parts explaining:
  • Where admin is saving data
  • Which API endpoints are used
  • How the frontend fetches course-wise content
- After implementing everything, briefly explain:
  • How admin can create/update content for a course purchase page
  • How a user goes from Available Courses → Enroll Now → Dynamic course purchase page.
